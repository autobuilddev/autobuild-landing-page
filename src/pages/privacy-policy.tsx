              </h2>
              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
                browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry
                or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do
                not respond to them at this time.

                Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate
                an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may
                deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit
                proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
                behalf in accordance with applicable laws.

              <h3>Request Verification</h3>
              <p>
                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your
                identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have
                the information in our system. We will only use personal
                information provided in your request to verify your identity or
                authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your
                identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
                request that you provide additional information for the purposes
                of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
                purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may
                need to collect additional information to verify your identity
                before processing your request and the agent will need to
                provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such
                request on your behalf.
              </p>
              <h3>Appeals</h3>
